Microwave ovens have many types of user interfaces, some more user-friendly than others. This program will implement several different interfaces for controlling microwave ovens.
SPECS
Method:
1) Define a Microwave class. This is an abstract class, i.e., there will be no objects of type Microwave, only objects of its subclasses.
Each microwave should display the cooking time in minutes and seconds as MM:SS and the power as a percent of the maximum power available. The power should be expressed in multiples of 10%, i.e., 100%, 90%, ..., 0%. (At 0% the oven won’t cook anything, but it can be used for a timer. This interesting fact is irrelevant to the assignment.) These fields should belong to the Microwave class.
2) Every microwave needs a way to set the cooking time and power. Define a subclass for each of the user interfaces below.
a)	The user can type in the minutes, seconds and power as integers. Make sure that your design shows that the minutes and seconds belong together (i.e., that the time shown is MM:SS) and that the power is a separate item. Edit each number for validity, i.e., the minutes and seconds must be between 0 and 59 and the power a multiple of 10 between 0 and 100.
b)	The minutes, seconds and power can be set from drop-down lists. This is bad design, since a 60 item drop-down list is too long for either common sense or convenience, but designers do this kind of thing. For example, some e commerce companies use drop down lists covering every country in the world even though most users will be coming from a small number of countries. Similarly, some transportation companies use a drop down list for a user’s birth year.
c)	There is a radio button that switches between minutes and seconds. There is a ‘+’ button that increases the minutes or seconds by 1 every time it is pressed, depending which option has been chosen. When either of those fields reaches 59, it becomes zero on the next click and then 1 again on the following click. There is a ‘-’ button that decrements power by 10% every time it is clicked. When power reaches 0%, the next click resets it to 100% and counting continues from there.
	Make sure the device is designed so that it is clear that the radio button and the ‘+’ apply to the minutes and seconds and the ‘-’ button applies to power.
d)	Same as c), including the radio button that switches between minutes and seconds. However, both the minutes/seconds and the power each have ‘+’ and ‘-’ buttons that increment and decrement respectively, the minutes and seconds by 1 and the power by 10%. This class should be a subclass of the previous class.
